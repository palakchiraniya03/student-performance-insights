# Student Performance Insights System

## About the Project
This project combines database analytics and machine learning to analyze
student academic records and predict performance outcomes.

## Key Features
- Structured student data using SQL tables
- Data analysis using Python and pandas
- Machine learning model for performance prediction
- Identification of academically at-risk students

## Technologies Used
- SQL
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Approach
A Logistic Regression model is used to predict whether a student is likely
to pass or fail based on attendance and internal assessment scores.

## Real-World Use Case
Educational institutions can use this system to identify students who may
need additional academic support.
